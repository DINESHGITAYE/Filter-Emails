# Filter-Emails
* __Description:__
In this task, we filter out the emails based on their subject like "Thank you for applying". This subject is nothing but the keyword & based on this keyword we filter out our emails.

# How to run code:
1. To run the code, first we have to enable IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) of our Gmail account.
2. Then we have to give access of our Gmail account to less secure apps so that we can fetch out our emails in jupyter notebook.
3. To make above changes in your Gmail account you have to follow the steps given in pdf called "Requirements to run code" which is provided with a code file. Also you can access this pdf file by [Clicking Here](https://github.com/DINESHGITAYE/Filter-Emails/blob/main/Requirements%20to%20run%20the%20code.pdf)
4. After making the above changes in your Gmail account you have to just run the code in jupyter notebook. you can access this code file by [Clicking Here](https://github.com/DINESHGITAYE/Filter-Emails/blob/main/Internship%20Task.ipynb)
5. **You have to put your email address and password after running the first line of the code.**

* __Apply code on clean data:__
  * **If you want to see the same results without doing above steps** then you have to download the dataset.csv file by [Clicking here] & run the code which given in the file called "Cross check the result". you can access this code file by [Clicking here]
